![Mood](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fec1ef6f-bb07-4034-a095-1d2538f1538f)



## Overview

This project is a simple web-based mood tracker that allows users to select their mood from a set of emojis, store their mood history, and visualize it on a calendar. It uses `localStorage` for persistence, ensuring the mood data is saved across page reloads. The calendar dynamically updates based on the selected mood for the current day.

## Features

- **Mood Selection:** Choose a mood using emoji buttons, which represent different emotional states like "Happy", "Sad", "Angry", "Chill", "Hugging", and "Tired".
- **Calendar Integration:** Display a calendar of the current month with color-coded days based on the selected mood for each day.
- **Mood History:** Save and view mood history. Each mood entry is stored with a timestamp and can be accessed even after refreshing the page.
- **Persistent Data:** Mood history and the selected mood for the current day are saved in `localStorage` to persist data even after page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Markup for the structure of the page.
- **CSS** - Styling for the calendar and mood display.
- **JavaScript** - Logic for mood tracking, calendar generation, and managing data in `localStorage`.
